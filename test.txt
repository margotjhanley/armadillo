summer tongue

hair, wet from the shower
long black strings (straps?), against my water sticky skin

“drop your head back”
the fan, made having my eyes closed peaceful
made instant silk out of my soggy skin

“here, my love”
circle sound of fan wind, and movement above my closed face
then a small purple berry in my mouth

berry lips
